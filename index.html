            <h2> Another Snake game? :P </h2>
            <p> At some point, every engineer has build a snake game in their career! Thanks to Nokia, no other games
                has hit this much craze in us than the good old hungry snake! </p>
            <p> I build this one in my college days. Now looking back at this, I felt really nostalgic! </p>
            <p> I did update some portaions of logics & UI over the old one & will continue to update more in my free
                time in future. Reviews & suggestions are highly appreciated. </p>
