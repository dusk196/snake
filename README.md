# Another SNAKE game? ðŸ˜œ 

[**DEMO**: https://dusk196.github.io/snake/](https://dusk196.github.io/snake/)

At some point, every engineer has build a snake game in their career! Thanks to Nokia, no other games has hit this much craze in us than the good old hungry snake!

I build this one in my college days. Now looking back at this, I was feeling kind of nostalgic!

I did update some portaions of logics & UI over the old one & will continue to update more in my free time. Huge shoutout to [**CodeWithHarry**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZDnw6ifdSI) for some suggestions & logics like audio & requestAnimationFrame. Reviews & suggestions are highly appreciated.
